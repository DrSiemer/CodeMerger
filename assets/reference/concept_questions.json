  "What specific user problem does this concept aim to solve, and for which user segment? Is the problem clearly defined in terms of pain, frequency, and impact?",
  "Which aspects of the concept lack sufficient specificity (inputs, outputs, constraints, success criteria), and where is additional detail required to enable implementation decisions?",
  "Do the stated goals, features, and constraints form a coherent and internally consistent system? Identify any logical tensions and explain their implications.",
  "Describe the primary user workflow end to end. Does each step logically follow from the previous one, and are there any missing transitions or decision points?",
  "What critical assumptions must hold true for this concept to succeed (technical, behavioral, data-related)? Which assumption is most fragile, and how could it be validated early?",
  "Which part of the concept presents the highest architectural or technical risk, and why? Suggest an alternative design or phased approach to mitigate this risk.",
  "If reduced to its smallest testable form, which capabilities are strictly essential to validate the core value proposition, and which can be deferred?",
  "What meaningfully differentiates this concept from existing solutions or common patterns, and are any features insufficiently justified by user value?",
  "How could this concept fail under real-world conditions (user error, incomplete data, degraded performance), and how should the system behave in those cases?",
  "What is the smallest independently useful capability that could be delivered early, and how would feedback from it inform subsequent iterations?"
