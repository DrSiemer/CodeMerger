  "Evaluate the overall structure of this plan. Does the task breakdown move from uncertainty to certainty (exploration → validation → implementation), or would a different sequencing reduce risk earlier?",
  "Identify any implicit assumptions in this plan (technical, product, or user-related). Which of these assumptions should be validated early, and how could the plan reflect that?",
  "Are all tasks phrased in a way that makes their outcome observable or verifiable? Highlight any items that are vague or outcome-ambiguous and suggest clearer formulations.",
  "Analyze task dependencies. Which tasks genuinely require prior completion of others, and which could be decoupled or parallelized to speed up progress?",
  "Which parts of the plan are best suited for rapid prototyping or spike solutions? Suggest where short-lived experiments could replace full implementations initially.",
  "For each planned testing or review point, define what decision it should enable (e.g., proceed, revise, discard). Are there missing decision checkpoints?",
  "Assess whether feedback loops are frequent enough. Where should the plan explicitly incorporate validation through tests, prototypes, benchmarks, or user feedback?",
  "Examine the scope of the initial delivery. What is the smallest coherent version of this project that would meaningfully reduce uncertainty or prove feasibility?",
  "Does the plan distinguish between reversible decisions (easy to change later) and irreversible or costly ones? How could high-impact decisions be deferred or de-risked?",
  "Review the plan for long-term maintainability risks. Are there areas where early shortcuts would create disproportionate future cost, and should they be addressed earlier?",
  "If requirements change mid-development, which parts of this plan are most fragile? Suggest ways to restructure tasks to localize or limit the impact of change."
