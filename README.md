# CodeMerger

A simple app for developers that prefer to stay in control and want to avoid working in AI powered IDE's. It allows you to define which files should be merged into a single string, so you can easily paste all relevant code into an LLM. Settings for a folder are stored in a .allcode file that can be committed with your project.

## Usage

- Select a working directory
- Add the files you want to manage (if you need additional filetypes, click "Manage Filetypes")
- Click "Copy merged" to merge all the selected files into a single string in your clipboard


## Development

- Run `go` to start
- Run `go b` to build executable
